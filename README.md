# Article Classification

(NOTE: This was created as the final assessment for my Advanced Python 1 Course)

## Introduction: 

This project is pretty simple; to understand the very basics of Artifical Intelligence, I built an Article Classifier!

## Workings:
The model uses logistic regression, a popular method in supervised machine learning for classification problems. The model achieved a high accuracy, with a training data accuracy of 99.7% and a test data accuracy of 97.3%. This means that the model was able to correctly classify the articles in the training dataset 99.7% of the time, and correctly classified new, unseen articles 97.3% of the time.

You can try out the model using the final code cell in ```Main.ipynb```. By entering a snippet of any article, the program will attempt to label that given snippet. This makes it easy to see the model in action and understand how it classifies different types of articles.

## Conclusion:

This project was a great way to understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning. It demonstrated how a simple model can be trained to perform complex tasks, such as categorizing articles based on their content.
